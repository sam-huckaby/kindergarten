# Kindergarten Parent Connect (I don't have a real name)

This app is designed to facilitate at-home learning for kindergarteners by making the flashcard process smoother.
It is pre-loaded with the sight words that my student is learning in school and randomly orders the display of all 58.
This app also uses the Lexend font, which is designed for clarity and ease of use with early readers, as well as the OpenDyslexic font for our friends who may need that.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Currently, the home page is the root page file (`app/page.tsx`), and the only assessment is located on /test (`app/test/page.tsx`).

Future plans would be to introduce additional assessments and other aids that may help children and parents succeed in learning.
